        Although some species can reproduce without fertilization, there are still male and female tardigrades.
        Two ducts run from the testis in males, opening through a single pore in front of the anus. In contrast,
        females have a single duct opening
        either just above the anus or directly into the rectum.
        <br>Tardigrades lay eggs. Fertilization is usually external. Mating occurs after eggs are laid then covered
        with sperm.
        A few species have internal fertilization, with mating occurring before the female fully sheds her cuticle.
        In most cases, the eggs are left inside the shed cuticle to develop, but some species attach them to nearby
        objects.
        The eggs hatch after no more than 14 days, with the young already possessing their full complement of adult
        Growth to the adult size
        therefore occurs by enlargement of the individual cells (hypertrophy), rather than by cell division.
        Tardigrades may molt up to 12 times.
        Tardigrades can live up to 200 years.
