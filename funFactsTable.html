                <p class="paragraph">While tardigrades may seem scary or weird to many people, they actually appear in
                    more popular
                    media than people think. Tardigrades have been featured in tv shows and the news. A small fanbase
                    creates home-made tardigrade dolls, stickers, cartoon drawings, and even a song.
