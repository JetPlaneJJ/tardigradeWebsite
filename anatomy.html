    <p class="paragraph"> Tardigrades are barrel-shaped
        and have four pairs of short legs. Most range from 0.3 to 0.5 mm
        (0.012 to 0.020 in) in length, although the largest species
        may reach 1.2 mm (0.047 in). They are quite tiny.
        <br>Their tubular mouth contain stylets, which are used to
        pierce their food. After piercing the food, the mouth opens into a sucking pharynx.
        The stylets are lost when it molts, and a new pair is secreted from a pair of glands
        that lie on either side of the mouth. The pharynx connects to a short esophagus, and then to
        an intestine that occupies much of the length of the body, its main site of digestion.
        The intestine leads to the rectum and out the anus.
        Some species only defecate when they molt, leaving the feces behind with the shed cuticle.
